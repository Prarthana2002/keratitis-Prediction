# Keratitis Severity Detection using Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning-powered web application for classifying Fusarium Keratitis severity levels from eye images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on medical image data to distinguish between:

🟡 Fusarium Keratitis - Mild

🔴 Fusarium Keratitis - Severe

✅ No Keratitis


🚀 Features
🔍 Upload an eye image and receive real-time prediction
📊 Displays predicted class and confidence score
🧠 Powered by a trained Keras CNN model
🖼️ Supports .jpg, .jpeg, and .png formats

📦 Requirements
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pillow (for image loading)

🧠 Model Info
Architecture: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Input Size: 128x128 RGB images

Output Classes:
Class 0: Fusarium Keratitis Mild
Class 1: Fusarium Keratitis Severe
Class 2: No Keratitis
Training Data: Medical eye images (dataset details excluded for privacy)

Output Images:
